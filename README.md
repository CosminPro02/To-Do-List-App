# ðŸ“‹ To-Do List
This is a simple To-Do List app that I built on my own to strengthen my understanding of React and Tailwind CSS. The goal was to practice state management, component structuring, and styling with utility classes.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
React â€“ for building the UI
Tailwind CSS â€“ for fast and flexible styling
âœ¨ Features
Add, delete, and mark tasks as completed
Simple and clean UI

ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This
I wanted to get more comfortable with React and Tailwind by working on a small but useful project. It helped me practice working with state, handling user interactions, and styling efficiently.
