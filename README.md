# 📋 To-Do List
This is a simple To-Do List app that I built on my own to strengthen my understanding of React and Tailwind CSS. The goal was to practice state management, component structuring, and styling with utility classes.

🚀 Technologies Used

React – for building the UI

Tailwind CSS – for fast and flexible styling

✨ Features

Add, delete, and mark tasks as completed

Simple and clean UI

💡 Why I Built This

I wanted to get more comfortable with React and Tailwind by working on a small but useful project. It helped me practice working with state, handling user interactions, and styling efficiently.
